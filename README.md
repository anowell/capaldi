- Individual
  - How is the individuals time committed across allocation categories?
- Team
  - How are the team's resources distributed across allocation categories?
  - How are the team's resources distributed across projects and releases?
- Org
  - How are the org's resources distributed across allocation categories?
  - How are the org's resources distributed across projects and releases?
  - How are the org's resources distributed over various time intervals (e.g. quarters)?
  - How are the org's resources distributed w.r.t. resource attributes such as role or FTE status?
